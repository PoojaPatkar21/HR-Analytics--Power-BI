# HR-Analytics--Power-BI

The HR Analytics Dashboard project is designed to provide in-depth insights into employee attrition through Power BI’s advanced data visualization tools. This project aims to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that analyzes attrition patterns based on key factors such as job role, education field, age, gender, years at the company, and average salary.

By leveraging Power BI’s capabilities, the dashboard will allow HR professionals to visualize and explore the relationship between these variables and employee turnover. The goal is to identify trends and correlations that may contribute to higher attrition rates, enabling organizations to implement targeted retention strategies.

The dashboard features dynamic charts, graphs, and KPIs that highlight critical aspects of employee attrition. For instance, it can reveal whether certain educational backgrounds or salary ranges are associated with higher turnover rates, or if specific demographic groups are more likely to leave the company. This analytical approach helps in making data-driven decisions to enhance employee retention and optimize HR practices.

Through this project, organizations will gain valuable insights into the factors influencing employee attrition, facilitating more effective workforce management and strategic planning.
